# 🏛️ Karyamitra – Data-Driven Productivity and Performance Evaluation System  
### _A Smart India Hackathon 2025 Project by Platform-404_

---

## 🌟 Overview
**Karyamitra** is a scalable, AI-powered, data-driven performance management platform designed for **government offices**.  
It addresses a critical gap in public sector productivity by introducing a **scientific, transparent, and real-time evaluation framework** that quantifies employee, team, and organizational performance based on **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**.

Developed under the **e-Office ecosystem**, it helps transform subjective appraisals into **objective, measurable outcomes**, driving efficiency, accountability, and motivation across all levels of government operations.

---

## 🧩 Background
Government offices, including the **Brahmaputra Board**, face persistent challenges of **low productivity and inefficiency** at the organizational, team, and individual levels.  
While headquarters employees handle administrative tasks (file processing, correspondence, approvals), field units focus on project-based work (DPR preparation, surveys, design, and execution).

Currently:
- Performance evaluation is **subjective**, based on **Annual Performance Appraisal Reports (APARs)**.  
- There is **no structured, digital mechanism** to measure real productivity.  
- Managers lack real-time insights to take corrective or data-driven decisions.  

This leads to:
- Lack of accountability and motivation  
- Inconsistent performance benchmarking  
- Limited ability to reward or correct performance objectively  

---

## 🎯 Vision
To build a **transparent, data-driven performance measurement module** under the **e-Office platform** that:
- Captures role-specific KPIs  
- Tracks progress through real-time dashboards  
- Generates continuous, automated performance insights  
- Improves employee engagement, accountability, and decision-making  

---

## 🚀 Objectives
1. **Define Role-Specific KPIs**  
   Create quantifiable metrics for each job category:
   - **Headquarters Staff** – File disposal rate, turnaround time, drafting quality, responsiveness, digital adoption.  
   - **Field Units** – DPR timeliness, project progress, budget utilization, compliance with technical standards.

2. **Develop a Weighted Scoring Model**  
   - Quantify performance on a **100-point scale**.  
   - Assign **weightages** for measurable outputs (timeliness, accuracy, progress) and qualitative factors (innovation, teamwork).

3. **Enable Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Dashboards at individual, team, division, and organizational levels.  
   - Continuous tracking of performance trends and productivity scores.

4. **Strengthen Accountability**  
   - Hybrid model combining automated quantitative data and limited qualitative feedback.

5. **Improve Employee Engagement**  
   - Employees can **view personal progress** against defined goals, fostering ownership and motivation.

6. **Enable Data-Driven Appraisals**  
   - Link quantified KPI scores to promotions, training, and recognition.

## ⚙️ How Performance Is Evaluated in Karyamitra

### 🧱 1. KPI Assignment
Each employee is assigned **role-specific KPIs (tasks or goals)** based on their position (HQ or field staff).  

### 🧾 2. Data Collection
The system automatically collects data from integrated sources such as:  
- e-Office records  
- Attendance and leave data  
- Project management systems  
- Field and progress reports  

### 📊 3. Real-Time Dashboards
Dashboards display performance insights for:  
- **Individual Level** – Personal task progress and KPI scores  
- **Team Level** – Comparison among team members  
- **Project/Organizational Level** – Consolidated reports for management  

### 🤖 4. AI Insights & Alerts
- Detects anomalies, declining productivity, or delays  
- Suggests corrective actions, resource redistribution, or training  
- Predicts performance risks using trend analytics
